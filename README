========================================
Welcome to the RDE project!
========================================

RDE: a 2d c++ dynamics engine for rigid bodies


========================================
Folder setup:
========================================
./src/			holds all source of RDE, the graphics back-end and the tutorial
./Release/		holds linux makes script
./src/RDE/		the RDE project itself
./src/graphics/	Graphics back-end

./src/RDE/ has both an include/ and a src/ folder again, this is a default library setup

========================================
Install notes for *nix like environments
========================================

Make sure before you start you have the following packages installed:
- GCC/G++ (the compiler..)
- Make 
- SDL
- SDL_dev

Step 1: Fire up a Console
Step 2: CD to RDE/Release (where RDE is the downloaded Repo)
Step 3: Type in "make", a lot of lines should pop up. No worries it is just compiling the source to a binary.
Step 4: When 3 was successful (no errors), there should be a Physics program in the same folder as the makefile.
Run it by "./PhysicsEngine" or launch it as you would do like a normal program.

If step 3 failed, try to see if you are missing any packages.
If launching the program failed, as in it quits right away or some error messages pop up, try to launch the program
from the console and check if any messages appear from the program.
If there is a direct error that it could not find any lib, try to check if you have openGL support.
